Use this extension to quickly add multiparty video chats to your application using the [Vonage Video Express](https://tokbox.com/developer/video-express/).

This extension will create rooms `/rooms/{roomId}` in Cloud Firestore and with Cloud Functions, generate credentials needed to participate in the video chats.

### Things you will need:

- Firebase [Cloud Functions](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/functions) and [Cloud Firestore](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/firestore) must be enabled in your project's console. The extension will need these to function properly.

- a Vonage Video Account. If you don't have one, you can sign up at the [Video API Dashboard](https://tokbox.com/account).

- Project API Key and Secret. In the left-side menu of the [dashboard](https://tokbox.com/account), click `Projects` and select a previous project or create a new one to view the API Key and Secret.
