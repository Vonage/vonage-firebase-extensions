To get started quickly, there is a demo application so that you can take a look at some code and deploy to Firebase hosting to see the Vonage Video Express in action.

The code can be found in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-firebase-extensions/tree/main/demos).

The Vonage CLI can be used to scaffold the demo application and be deployed to Firebase hosting.
