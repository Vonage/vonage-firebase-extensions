## Getting started with Video Express

### Documentation

To get an overview and reference for the API, visit the [Video Express documentation](https://tokbox.com/developer/video-express/).

### Demo application

To get started quickly, there is a demo application so that you can take a look at some code and deploy to Firebase hosting to see the Vonage Video Express in action.

The code can be found in this [GitHub repo]().

The Vonage CLI can be used to scaffold the demo application and be deployed to Firebase hosting.
