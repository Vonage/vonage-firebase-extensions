<!-- 
This file provides your users an overview of your extension. All content is optional, but this is the recommended format. Your users will see the contents of this file when they run the `firebase ext:info` command.

Include any important functional details as well as a brief description for any additional setup required by the user (both pre- and post-installation).

This extension allows you to easily send a message such as an SMS, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or Viber message from your Firebase application using the [Vonage Messaging API](https://developer.vonage.com/en/messages/overview).

This extension adds a Firebase Function that allows you to send a Message from either the backend of a Firebase application, or from a client-side application while keeping your credentials secret. 

### Things you will need:

- Firebase [Cloud Functions](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/functions) must be enabled in your project's console. The extension will need this to function properly.

- A Vonage API Developer Account. If you don't have one, you can sign up at the [Vonage Customer Dashboard](https://ui.idp.vonage.com/ui/auth/registration).

- A Vonage Application with Messages enabled, and the associated Application ID and Private Key. See the [Vonage Developer Portal](https://developer.vonage.com/en/application/overview) for information on configuring a Vonage Application. The Private Key should be [base64 formatted](https://developer.vonage.com/en/blog/using-private-keys-in-environment-variables).
